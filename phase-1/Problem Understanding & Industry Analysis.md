# Project: Professional Development & Training Course Management System

## Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

### Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive Salesforce-based system to streamline and enhance the management of professional development and training courses within an organization. It will address challenges related to course cataloging, participant enrollment, progress tracking, resource scheduling, and measuring training effectiveness.

### Problem Statement
Organizations frequently face significant hurdles in effectively managing their professional development and training initiatives. Without a centralized and automated system, common challenges include:

1.  **Administrative Overhead & Inefficiency:** Manual processes involving spreadsheets, emails, and paper forms for course registration, scheduling, and record-keeping consume excessive administrative time and are prone to human error. This often leads to conflicting schedules, lost records, and delayed communications.
2.  **Lack of Visibility & Reporting:** It's difficult to gain a holistic view of available courses, participant enrollment trends, completion rates, and overall training impact. Managers struggle to track employee skill development, and L&D teams cannot easily identify popular courses or areas needing more training.
3.  **Poor Participant Experience:** Employees often find it challenging to discover relevant courses, register, or track their own progress. Inconsistent communication (confirmations, reminders) can lead to missed sessions and frustration, hindering engagement with professional development programs.
4.  **Resource Management Challenges:** Scheduling instructors, training rooms, or specialized equipment without real-time availability checks can lead to double-bookings and operational bottlenecks, impacting the quality and delivery of training.
5.  **Compliance & Certification Gaps:** For industries with mandatory training or certifications, manual tracking makes it difficult to ensure compliance and audit employee qualifications, exposing the organization to potential risks.

This project seeks to mitigate these issues by providing a robust, automated, and user-friendly platform within Salesforce.

### 1. Requirement Gathering

Based on the identified problems and stakeholder needs, the system must fulfill the following core requirements. These requirements will directly inform the design of our data model, user interface, and automation.

**A. Course & Offering Management:**
1.  The system MUST allow L&D Administrators to create and manage a catalog of `Courses` (e.g., Title, Description, Duration, Cost, Prerequisites, Recommended Skills).
2.  The system MUST allow L&D Administrators to create and manage specific `Course Offerings` (scheduled instances of a course) including:
    *   Specific `Start` and `End Dates/Times`.
    *   `Location` (physical room, virtual meeting link, or self-paced).
    *   Assigned `Instructor`.
    *   Maximum `Capacity` for the offering.
3.  The system MUST track the current `Status` of a course (e.g., Draft, Active, Archived) and a course offering (e.g., Scheduled, Open for Registration, Full, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled).
4.  The system MUST provide a comprehensive view of all `Course Offerings` for a given `Course`.
5.  The system SHOULD support different `Course Types` (e.g., Webinar, In-Person Training, Self-Paced Module) with potentially different relevant fields.

**B. Participant Enrollment & Tracking:**
6.  The system MUST allow participants (employees or contacts) to `Enroll` in an `Open` `Course Offering`.
7.  The system MUST prevent participants from `Enrolling` in `Course Offerings` that are `Full` or `Cancelled`.
8.  The system MUST prevent `Enrollment` in two `Course Offerings` that overlap in time for the same participant.
9.  The system MUST track `Enrollment Status` (e.g., Registered, In Progress, Completed, Withdrawn, No Show).
10. The system MUST record the `Enrollment Date` and `Completion Date` for each participant.
11. The system MUST allow L&D Administrators or Instructors to easily update `Enrollment Status` for multiple participants after a course offering is complete.
12. The system MUST allow a participant to view all `Courses` they are `Registered` for or have `Completed`.
13. The system SHOULD allow L&D Administrators to manage a `Waitlist` for full `Course Offerings`.

**C. Instructor Management:**
14. The system MUST allow L&D Administrators to manage a list of `Instructors` with their contact details, specializations, and availability.
15. The system MUST allow `Instructors` to view their assigned `Course Offerings` and the list of `Enrolled` participants.
16. The system SHOULD prevent an `Instructor` from being double-booked for `Course Offerings` that overlap in time.

**D. Automation & Notifications:**
17. The system MUST send automated `Email Confirmations` to participants upon successful `Enrollment`.
18. The system MUST send automated `Reminder Emails` to participants 1-2 days before a `Course Offering` begins.
19. The system SHOULD notify L&D Administrators when a `Course Offering` reaches its `Max Capacity` and changes to `Full` status.
20. The system SHOULD automatically update a `Course Offering's Status` to 'In Progress' at its start time and 'Completed' at its end time.
21. The system SHOULD send a `Certificate of Completion` via email upon course completion.

**E. Reporting & Analytics:**
22. The system MUST provide `Reports` on:
    *   Course popularity (most enrolled courses).
    *   Enrollment trends over time.
    *   Completion rates across different courses and offerings.
    *   Instructor utilization.
    *   Training costs (if applicable).
23. The system MUST provide `Dashboards` to visualize key training metrics for L&D and management.

### 2. Stakeholder Analysis

Understanding the key users and their specific needs and interests is crucial for designing a system that effectively serves everyone.

*   **L&D Administrator (Primary User)**
    *   **Role:** Responsible for planning, organizing, and executing training programs.
    *   **Interests:** Efficient course creation and scheduling, easy participant management, real-time status updates, streamlined communication, robust reporting on training effectiveness.
    *   **Key Needs:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access to all training-related objects, automation tools for tasks like emails and status updates, ability to pull comprehensive reports.

### 3. Business Process Mapping

This section outlines the primary workflow for managing a training program using the new Salesforce system. A visual flowchart (which you would create as an image) is critical here.

**Description of the Core Process:**

1.  **Course Definition:** The L&D Administrator first defines a `Course` in the system, detailing its content, duration, and any prerequisites.
2.  **Course Offering Scheduling:** For a specific `Course`, the L&D Administrator then creates a `Course Offering`. This includes setting specific dates, times, location, assigning an `Instructor`, and defining the maximum `Capacity`.
3.  **Registration Opening:** The `Course Offering` is then marked as 'Open for Registration'.
4.  **Participant Enrollment:**
    *   **Self-Service:** Participants browse available 'Open' `Course Offerings` (e.g., via a list view or a custom LWC) and `Enroll` themselves.
    *   **Admin Enrollment:** An L&D Administrator can also manually `Enroll` participants.
    *   Upon successful `Enrollment`, an `Enrollment` record is created for the participant linked to the `Course Offering`. The `Current Enrollments` count on the `Course Offering` increases.
5.  **Automated Confirmation:** The system automatically sends an `Email Confirmation` to the participant.
6.  **Capacity Check:** The system continuously monitors `Current Enrollments` against `Max Capacity`. If `Max Capacity` is reached, the `Course Offering` `Status` automatically updates to 'Full', and further enrollments are prevented.
7.  **Automated Reminder:** One to two days before the `Course Offering` begins, an automated `Reminder Email` is sent to all `Registered` participants.
8.  **Course Delivery & Status Update:**
    *   At the `Course Offering` start time, its `Status` automatically updates to 'In Progress'.
    *   After the course is delivered, the Instructor or L&D Administrator updates the `Enrollment Status` for each participant (e.g., from 'Registered' to 'Completed', 'Withdrawn', or 'No Show').
9.  **Skill Acquisition (Optional):** If a participant `Completed` the course, a `Skill Acquisition` record may be created, linking the participant to the `Recommended Skill` taught by the course.
10. **Reporting:** L&D and Management regularly review `Reports` and `Dashboards` to analyze course popularity, completion rates, and overall training impact.
